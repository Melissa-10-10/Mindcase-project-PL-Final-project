# MindEase – Smart Mental Health Support and
Tracking System

## INTRODUTION

MindEase is a smart mental health support and tracking system that helps users monitor and
manage their emotional well-being. The platform allows users to log their moods, perform quick
self-assessments, and receive tailored recommendations to improve their mental health. It uses
data analysis to identify mood patterns and provide timely advice or professional guidance. This
system encourages early mental health awareness and self-care.



## BUSINESS PROCESS MODELING

MindCase collects user mood data, validates login credentials, and stores all information in the database. The system retrieves the user’s mood history, analyzes emotional patterns, and generates personalized mental-health recommendations through its Recommendation Engine. These recommendations are then delivered back to the user. In high-risk cases, the system alerts a mental-health professional, who provides guidance that is sent directly to the user through the platform.
